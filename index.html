<h3>About Me</h3>
<p id='introp'>
  Hi! My name is Sam and I'm excited to get started at Galvanize. I'm 23 years old, from Orono, Minnesota. I just moved to Denver after having spent the last two summers out here. I like sports, hockey being my favorite. In my free time I like to golf, workout and hang with friends.
