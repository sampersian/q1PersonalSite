  Hi! My name is Sam and I'm excited to get started at Galvanize. I'm 22 years old, from Orono, Minnesota. I just moved to Denver after having spent the last two summers out here. I have one older brother, Ben, who graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 2015 and is now stationed in Tucson, Arizona. I like sports, hockey being my favorite. In my free time I like to golf, workout and hang with friends.
